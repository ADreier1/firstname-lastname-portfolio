  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>My name is Ashley, I am 25 years old and was born and raised in Wisconsin. I currently work for a website company, which I started here with no experience in anything towards computers. I keep learning new things each and every day and am really beginning to enjoy working here.</p>
  <p>I find that what is most important to me is living your life to the fullest and living a happy life. Sure, there are many struggles in life that everyone will endure, but I try to stay positive through everything, so I can be happy and make the people around me happy as well.</p>
